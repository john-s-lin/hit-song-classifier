## Rules

The `main` branch is locked from modification. Please create a branch off `main` to add your changes and make a PR to main in order to merge your changes.

### Branch naming convention

Branch names should preferably be as follows: `<name>/your_task_for_the_project`. For example, if John is adding a decision tree model, his branch would be called:

```
john/add_decision_tree
```

### Making a Pull Request (PR)

Once you are satisfied with your changes, you may make a pull request to merge your changes to main. Your changes can only be merged when at least one other member approves your PR.
