SOEN-471 Group Project: Using classification to predict song rankings from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/)

## Rules

The `main` branch is locked from modification. Please create a branch off `main` to add your changes and make a PR to main in order to merge your changes.

### Trunk-based development

Due to its simplicity and the fact that we don't have to deliver "big" features, we will be using [trunk-based development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development). This means small features and PRs are made directly to the main branch.

### Branch naming convention

Branch names should preferably be as follows: `<name>/your_task_for_the_project`. For example, if John is adding a decision tree model, his branch would be called:

```
john/add_decision_tree
```

### Making a Pull Request (PR)

Once you are satisfied with your changes, you may make a pull request to merge your changes to main. Your changes can only be merged when at least one other member approves your PR.
